# Maven-Data---Apple-s-Greenhouse-Gas-Emissions


About this project
As part of the Maven Environmental Challenge, my role involves functioning as an independent journalist and a data visualization enthusiast. My assignment is to leverage the data presented in Apple's Environmental Progress Reports to create visual representations that illustrate and communicate Apple's advancements in working towards achieving carbon neutrality by the year 2030.

Insights:

By 2022, Apple had successfully cut its carbon emissions by 47.17%, equivalent to approximately 20.3 million metric tons of CO2e.
Despite a remarkable 68.7% increase in revenue by 2022, suggesting that its sustainability efforts did not adversely affect sales, Apple achieved a significant reduction in carbon emissions.
Starting in 2019, corporate carbon emissions began to decline, leading to Apple's attainment of carbon neutrality in its corporate operations by 2020.
The emissions associated with the life cycle of Apple products exhibited a gradual decrease, dropping from 38 million metric tons in 2015 to 20.2 million in 2022.
Among the stages in the product life cycle, manufacturing contributed the most to carbon emissions at 66.3%, followed by product use at 24.3%, and product transportation at 9.4%. Despite this, Apple's innovative practices have played a crucial role in mitigating emissions over the years.
Apple's pursuit of net-zero carbon emissions not only had positive environmental implications but also bolstered the company's revenue and market capitalization. In 2020, when Apple introduced its 2030 carbon neutrality program, both revenue and market share experienced growth.
Through continuous innovation, Apple successfully reduced the carbon footprint of its recent products. While the iPhone X had the highest carbon footprint at 79 kg CO2e, newer products, like the iPhone 15, have significantly decreased this number to 56 kg CO2e, comparable to older models such as the iPhone 7 and 6s. This trend underscores the compatibility of innovation and sustainability.
Starting in 2020, Apple also made investments in carbon offset programs, resulting in a reduction of 1.06 million metric tons of CO2e over the years.
Recommendations:

It is essential to inform and educate customers on optimizing their devices to minimize their carbon footprint. Emphasizing the importance of device recycling should be a priority.
Apple's dedication to sustainability is laudable and serves as a source of inspiration for numerous businesses to reassess their operational practices. With ongoing investments in new innovations, both in the manufacturing process and carbon offset programs, it is anticipated that Apple will successfully reach its goal of reducing carbon emissions to 9.6 million metric tons of CO2 by 2027.
